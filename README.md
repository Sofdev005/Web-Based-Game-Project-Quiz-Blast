##  Game Overview

The game is designed around a simple but expandable gameplay loop:

* The player interacts through a clean, intuitive web interface  
* Game state is dynamically managed using JavaScript  
* User actions directly affect score and progression  
* Architecture allows easy extension (difficulty scaling, leaderboard, persistence)
